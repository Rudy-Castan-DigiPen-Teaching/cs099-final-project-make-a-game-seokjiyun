Read below for the actual license but the gist is that you can use the illustrations in any project, commercial or personal without attribution or any costs. Just don’t try to replicate ManyPixels, redistribute in packs the illustrations or create integrations for it.

If you are working on something and want to use illustrations to improve its appearance, modified or not, without the need for attribution or cost, you are good to go. If you find ManyPixels or its illustrations to be in the center of what you are doing (e.g. sell or re-distribute one/some of them, add them in an app), then you probably should not proceed.
